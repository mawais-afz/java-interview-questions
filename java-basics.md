# Java Basics, JVM Internals & Language Components

## Core Java & Platform

1. **What is Java?**

   Java is a popular, versatile, and object-oriented programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability. It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. Java is used for developing a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise software.

2. **Explain the main idea behind Java and the concept of WORA**

   The main idea behind Java is to create a language that is simple, secure, and platform-independent. The concept of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) is one of Java's core principles, which means:

   - Java code is first compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode
   - This bytecode can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed
   - The JVM acts as an interpreter between the bytecode and the underlying operating system
   - Developers don't need to rewrite or recompile code for different platforms
   - The same Java application can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, or any other platform with a JVM
   - This platform independence significantly reduces development and maintenance costs

   This approach differs from traditional languages like C/C++, which require platform-specific compilation and often need code modifications to work on different operating systems.

3. **List some important features of Java.**

   - **Platform Independence**: Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, making them highly portable.
   - **Object-Oriented**: Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, which helps in organizing complex programs into simpler, reusable pieces.
   - **Robust and Secure**: Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and security features that make it a reliable and secure language.
   - **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU.
   - **Automatic Memory Management**: Java uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks and other related issues.
   - **Rich Standard Library**: Java comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides many useful utilities and frameworks for various tasks.
   - **High Performance**: Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and efficient runtime environment contribute to its high performance.
   - **Distributed Computing**: Java supports distributed computing through its networking capabilities, making it suitable for developing large-scale distributed applications.
   - **Dynamic and Extensible**: Java is designed to adapt to evolving environments, with features like dynamic class loading and reflection.
   - **Community Support**: Java has a large and active community, providing extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks to support development.

4. **Can you list some non-object oriented features of Java?**

   - **Primitive Data Types**: Java supports eight primitive data types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char) that are not objects.
   - **Static Members**: Static methods and variables belong to the class rather than instances, resembling procedural programming.
   - **Arrays**: While arrays are objects in Java, they provide low-level, fixed-size data storage similar to procedural languages.
   - **Operator Overloading**: Java deliberately excludes operator overloading to maintain simplicity, unlike some OOP languages.
   - **Multiple Inheritance**: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes (though it allows multiple interface implementation).
   - **Procedural Programming**: Java allows writing procedural code within methods, without necessarily using objects.
   - **Pass-by-Value**: Java strictly uses pass-by-value semantics, even for object references.
   - **Global Variables**: Through static fields, Java provides a way to create globally accessible variables.
   - **Command-Line Programming**: Java supports console-based, procedural programming through the main method.

5. **Why is Java Dynamic?**

   Java is considered dynamic due to several key features:

   - **Dynamic Class Loading**: Java can load classes at runtime as needed, rather than loading all classes at startup
   - **Reflection**: Allows programs to examine and modify their structure and behavior at runtime
   - **Late Binding**: Method calls are resolved at runtime rather than compile time
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Objects are allocated memory dynamically at runtime
   - **Runtime Polymorphism**: The specific method implementation to be executed is determined at runtime
   - **Dynamic Array Bounds**: Array bounds are checked dynamically at runtime
   - **Dynamic Security**: Security policies can be configured and enforced at runtime

6. **Distinguish between static loading and dynamic class loading?**

   Static loading and dynamic class loading are two different approaches to loading classes in Java:

   **Static Loading (Load-Time Loading)**:

   - Classes are loaded at compile time
   - All required classes must be available when the program starts
   - Uses the `new` keyword/operator for object creation
   - Loading happens automatically when the program starts
   - More predictable but less flexible
   - Better performance as classes are loaded upfront
   - Memory is allocated at startup for all classes

   Example of Static Loading:

   ```java
   class TestClass {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
       TestClass tc = new TestClass();
     }
   }
   ```

   **Dynamic Loading (Runtime Loading)**:

   - Classes are loaded on-demand at runtime
   - Classes can be loaded when needed, not necessarily at startup
   - Uses `Class.forName()` or `ClassLoader` methods
   - Loading happens explicitly when requested in code
   - More flexible and memory efficient
   - Allows for plugin architectures and modular applications
   - Can handle situations where class locations are not known at compile time
   - May have slight performance overhead due to runtime loading
   - Requires exception handling

   Example of Dynamic Loading:

   ```java
   try {
       Class.forName("com.example.MyClass");
   } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
       // Handle the exception
   }
   ```

7. **What is the difference between JavaEE and JavaSE?**

   JavaSE (Java Standard Edition) and JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) are different platforms within the Java ecosystem:

   **Java SE (Standard Edition)**:

   - The core Java platform, providing fundamental Java programming features
   - Contains core libraries and APIs for general-purpose programming
   - Includes basic functionality like collections, I/O, networking, GUI development
   - Used for developing desktop and simple server applications
   - Foundation for other Java editions

   **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**:

   - Built on top of JavaSE, adding enterprise features
   - Designed for developing large-scale, distributed, multi-tiered enterprise applications
   - Provides additional APIs and services for:
     - Web Applications (Servlets, JSP)
     - Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
     - Java Persistence API (JPA)
     - Java Message Service (JMS)
     - Java Transaction API (JTA)
     - Web Services
   - Includes specifications for security, scalability, and reliability
   - Requires an application server (like WildFly, WebSphere, or GlassFish)

   Note: JavaEE has been renamed to Jakarta EE after Oracle transferred it to the Eclipse Foundation.

8. **Explain JDK, JRE, and JVM**

   | Component | Full Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | JDK       | Java Development Kit     | A software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development. |
   | JRE       | Java Runtime Environment | Provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files.                                                                                               |
   | JVM       | Java Virtual Machine     | An abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed, ensuring platform independence.                                                               |

9. **What is a ClassLoader? And its role in Java?**

   A ClassLoader in Java is a fundamental component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) responsible for loading Java classes and interfaces into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) during runtime. Its primary role is to convert Java bytecode (.class files) into Class objects that can be used by the JVM.

   Key responsibilities of a ClassLoader include:

   - **Loading Classes**: Reads the bytecode from .class files and creates Class objects
   - **Security**: Ensures classes are loaded from trusted sources and meet Java specifications
   - **Namespace Management**: Maintains separate namespaces for different types of classes
   - **Dynamic Loading**: Loads classes on-demand when they are first referenced

   Java provides three built-in ClassLoaders, each with specific responsibilities:

   - **Bootstrap ClassLoader**:

     - Written in native code (not Java)
     - Loads core Java API classes from rt.jar
     - Parent of all other ClassLoaders

   - **Extension ClassLoader**:

     - Loads classes from extension directories (JAVA_HOME/lib/ext)
     - Child of Bootstrap ClassLoader

   - **System/Application ClassLoader**:
     - Loads application classes from classpath
     - Child of Extension ClassLoader
     - Used to load application-specific classes

   ClassLoaders follow important principles:

   1. **Delegation Hierarchy**: Before loading a class, a ClassLoader asks its parent first
   2. **Visibility**: Child ClassLoaders can see classes loaded by parents, but not vice versa
   3. **Uniqueness**: Same class loaded by different ClassLoaders are treated as different types
   4. **Non-delegation**: Each ClassLoader should load a class only once

10. **What is the difference between path and classpath?**

    | Aspect  | PATH                                                   | CLASSPATH                                           |
    | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | Purpose | System environment variable to locate executables      | Java-specific variable to locate class files        |
    | Usage   | Finds OS commands and programs (e.g., java, javac)     | Helps JVM find and load Java classes during runtime |
    | Content | Directory paths containing executable files            | Paths to .class files, JAR files, and packages      |
    | Scope   | Operating system level                                 | Java application level                              |
    | Format  | OS-specific path separator (: for Unix, ; for Windows) | Similar path separator but for Java class locations |
    | Default | Usually pre-configured by OS installation              | Current directory (.) if not explicitly set         |

    Example PATH:

    ```
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
    ```

    Example CLASSPATH:

    ```
    .:/home/user/classes:/home/user/lib/example.jar
    ```

## Memory Management & Garbage Collection

11. **What are the Memory Allocations available in Java**

    Java's memory structure consists of several key areas:

    1. **Stack Memory**:

       - Used for storing method frames and local variables
       - Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order
       - Automatically allocated and deallocated
       - Thread-specific - each thread has its own stack
       - Stores primitive values and object references

    2. **Heap Memory**:

       - Shared runtime memory area
       - Stores all objects and arrays
       - Managed by Garbage Collector
       - Divided into:
         - Young Generation (Eden Space, Survivor Spaces)
         - Old Generation
         - Permanent Generation (Removed in Java 8+)

    3. **Class(Method) Area (Metaspace)**:

       - Stores class metadata, methods, and static variables
       - Shared across all threads
       - Part of native memory (not heap) since Java 8

    4. **Program Counter (PC) Register**:

       - Per-thread register
       - Holds address of current executing instruction
       - Helps with thread execution management

    5. **Native Method Stack**:
       - Supports native method execution
       - Used for C/C++ calls from Java
       - One per thread

    Each memory area serves a specific purpose in Java's memory management system, contributing to the language's efficiency and reliability.

12. **The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?**

    Serial and Parallel Garbage Collectors differ in several key aspects:

    1. **Serial Garbage Collector**:

       - Single-threaded collector
       - Uses only one CPU core
       - Stops all application threads during GC ("stop-the-world")
       - Best suited for:
         - Single-processor systems
         - Small applications with small heap sizes
         - Simple desktop applications
       - Enabled using -XX:+UseSerialGC

    2. **Parallel Garbage Collector**:
       - Multi-threaded collector
       - Uses multiple CPU cores simultaneously
       - Still has "stop-the-world" pauses but shorter duration
       - Best suited for:
         - Multi-processor/multi-core systems
         - Applications with medium to large heap sizes
         - Batch processing where throughput is important
       - Enabled using -XX:+UseParallelGC
       - Can configure number of threads using -XX:ParallelGCThreads

    The main tradeoff is between simplicity (Serial) and performance (Parallel), with Parallel GC generally providing better throughput on modern hardware.

13. **How does the Garbage Collector algorithm work? Or How does garbage collection work in Java?**

    Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is an automatic memory management process that identifies and removes unused objects from heap memory. Here's how it works:

    1. **Object Marking**:

       - Starts from "root" references (static variables, local variables, etc.)
       - Traverses object graph marking all reachable objects as "live"
       - Any objects not marked are considered garbage

    2. **Memory Allocation Phases**:

       - Objects are first allocated in Eden space (Young Generation)
       - Surviving objects move to Survivor spaces
       - Long-lived objects promote to Old Generation

    3. **Collection Process**:

       - **Minor GC**:

         - Collects Young Generation only
         - More frequent but faster
         - Uses "Copy and Compact" approach

       - **Major GC**:
         - Collects Old Generation
         - Less frequent but more time-consuming
         - May use different algorithms (Mark-Sweep-Compact)

    4. **Key Algorithms**:
       - Mark-Sweep: Marks live objects, removes unmarked
       - Mark-Compact: Additionally compacts memory after sweep
       - Copy Collection: Copies live objects to new space
       - Generational Collection: Different strategies for young/old objects

    The GC process is automatic but can be influenced through JVM parameters and choice of collector implementation (Serial, Parallel, CMS, G1, ZGC).

14. **What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?**

    | Aspect            | Stack Memory                                                 | Heap Memory                                     |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
    | Memory Type       | Static memory allocation                                     | Dynamic memory allocation                       |
    | Access Speed      | Faster access                                                | Relatively slower access                        |
    | Memory Management | Automatic (LIFO order)                                       | Manual allocation, automatic deallocation by GC |
    | Size              | Smaller, fixed size                                          | Larger, flexible size                           |
    | Thread Safety     | Each thread has own stack                                    | Shared across all threads                       |
    | Storage           | Primitive values, method frames, local variables, references | Objects, arrays, class instances                |
    | Lifetime          | Short-lived - exists for method duration                     | Objects persist until no references remain      |
    | Memory Order      | Contiguous memory blocks                                     | No specific memory order                        |
    | Memory Control    | Size controlled by JVM (-Xss)                                | Initial/Max size controlled by JVM (-Xms/-Xmx)  |
    | Memory Errors     | StackOverflowError                                           | OutOfMemoryError                                |

15. **What are the possible ways of making object eligible for garbage collection (GC) in Java?**

    An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when it is no longer reachable. Here are the main ways to make an object eligible for GC:

    1. **Nullifying References**:

       - Set object references to null
       - Example: `Student student = new Student(); student = null;`

    2. **Reassigning References**:

       - Point reference variable to another object
       - Original object becomes unreachable
       - Example: `student = new Student();` // old object eligible for GC

    3. **Object goes out of Scope**:

       - Local objects become eligible when method ends
       - Example:
         ```java
         void method() {
             Student student = new Student(); // eligible after method ends
         }
         ```

    4. **Island of Isolation**:

       - Objects only reference each other but no external references
       - Example:
         ```java
         class Node {
             Node next;
             // Circular reference but no external reference
             Node a = new Node();
             Node b = new Node();
             a.next = b;
             b.next = a;
             a = b = null; // Island now eligible for GC
         }
         ```

    5. **Removing References from Collections**:
       - Clear collections or remove objects from them
       - Example: `list.clear();` or `map.remove(key);`

16. **What is a Memory Leak? Discuss some common causes of it.**

    A memory leak occurs when a program fails to release memory that is no longer needed, causing the application to consume more and more memory over time. In Java, despite having garbage collection, memory leaks can still occur.

    Common causes of memory leaks in Java:

    1. **Unclosed Resources**

       - Not closing database connections
       - Not closing file streams
       - Not releasing network sockets

    2. **Static References**

       - Adding objects to static collections but never removing them
       - Static fields holding references to objects that should be temporary

    3. **Inner Class References**

       - Non-static inner classes holding implicit references to their outer class
       - Anonymous classes in long-living objects

    4. **Improper equals()/hashCode() Implementation**

       - Objects stored in HashSet/HashMap but with poorly implemented equality methods
       - Leading to duplicate objects accumulating

    5. **Thread-Local Variables**
       - Not removing ThreadLocal variables when no longer needed
       - Especially in application servers where threads are reused

    Example of a potential memory leak:

    ```java
    public class Cache {
        private static final Map<String, Object> cache = new HashMap<>();

        public void addToCache(String key, Object value) {
            cache.put(key, value);  // Objects are never removed!
        }
    }
    ```

    Prevention strategies:

    - Always close resources using try-with-resources
    - Use WeakHashMap for caches when appropriate
    - Implement proper cleanup methods
    - Profile application memory usage regularly
    - Use memory analysis tools (like JProfiler, MAT)

## Variables & Data Types

1. **What is a Java Variable?**

   A Java variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value of a specific data type. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.

   | Aspect            | Description                                                                                                        |
   | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Definition        | A named container for storing data values                                                                          |
   | Declaration       | Specifies the variable's name and data type                                                                        |
   | Initialization    | Assigns an initial value to the variable                                                                           |
   | Scope             | Determines where the variable can be accessed within the code                                                      |
   | Data Types        | Can be primitive (byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char) or reference (objects, arrays, interfaces) |
   | Naming Convention | Follows camelCase, starts with a letter, $, or \_                                                                  |
   | Example           | `int age = 25;` or `String name = "John";`                                                                         |

2. **What are data types?**

   Data types in Java specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Java has two categories of data types:

   | Category             | Data Types    | Description                                                                                                                                                | Size    |
   | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
   | Primitive Data Types | byte          | - 8-bit signed two's complement integer<br>- Minimum value is -128 (-2^7)<br>- Maximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)<br>- Default value is 0<br>        | 1 byte  |

   Primitive types are predefined by the language and named by a keyword. Reference data types are created by the programmer and are not defined by the language (except for String).

3. **What are literals in Java?**

   Literals are fixed values that can be directly used in code. Java supports several types of literals:

   | Type                    | Description                 | Examples                                                                           |
   | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Integer Literals        | Fixed whole number values   | Decimal: `42`<br>Hexadecimal: `0xFF`<br>Binary: `0b1010`<br>Long: `42L`            |
   | Floating-Point Literals | Fixed decimal number values | Float: `3.14f`<br>Double: `3.14` or `3.14d`<br>Scientific notation: `1.23e4`       |
   | Character Literals      | Single character values     | Single character: `'A'`<br>Unicode: `'\u0041'`<br>Escape sequences: `'\n'`, `'\t'` |
   | String Literals         | Text values                 | Regular string: `"Hello World"`<br>String with escape sequences: `"Hello\nWorld"`  |
   | Boolean Literals        | Logical values              | `true`, `false`                                                                    |
   | Null Literal            | Empty reference value       | `null`                                                                             |

   Example:

   ```java
   int decimal = 42;
   double pi = 3.14;
   char letter = 'A';
   String message = "Hello";
   boolean flag = true;
   Object obj = null;
   ```

4. **What are wrapper classes? Why do we need wrapper classes?**

   Wrapper classes in Java are used to convert primitive data types into objects. Each primitive type has a corresponding wrapper class that provides a way to use these primitives as objects. This is particularly useful in situations where objects are required, such as in collections like ArrayList. The wrapper classes in Java include:

   - **Integer**: for int
   - **Double**: for double
   - **Character**: for char
   - **Boolean**: for boolean
   - **Byte**: for byte
   - **Short**: for short
   - **Long**: for long
   - **Float**: for float

   We need wrapper classes for several reasons:

   1. **Collections**: Java collections like ArrayList can only store objects, not primitives
   2. **Null values**: Primitives cannot be null, but wrapper objects can represent null values
   3. **Utility methods**: Wrapper classes provide helpful methods for:
      - Type conversion (e.g., Integer.parseInt())
      - Value comparison
      - Number formatting
   4. **Generics**: Type parameters in generic classes must be objects
   5. **Synchronization**: Objects are needed for synchronization in multithreading

   Wrapper classes also enable automatic boxing (primitive to wrapper) and unboxing (wrapper to primitive), making it convenient to work with both forms:

   ```java
   Integer num = 5;    // autoboxing
   int value = num;    // auto-unboxing
   ```

5. **What are the different ways of creating Wrapper class instances? Or What are differences in the two ways of creating Wrapper classes?**

   There are several ways to create wrapper class instances in Java:

   1. **Using Constructor (Deprecated)**:

   ```java
   Integer num1 = new Integer(42);        // Deprecated since Java 9
   Double dbl1 = new Double(3.14);        // Not recommended
   ```

   2. **Using Static Factory Methods**:

   ```java
   Integer num2 = Integer.valueOf(42);    // Preferred method
   Double dbl2 = Double.valueOf(3.14);    // Recommended approach
   ```

   3. **Autoboxing (Automatic Conversion)**:

   ```java
   Integer num3 = 42;                     // Autoboxing primitive to wrapper
   Double dbl3 = 3.14;                    // Automatic conversion
   ```

   4. **Parsing from Strings**:

   ```java
   Integer num4 = Integer.parseInt("42");     // Convert string to Integer
   Double dbl4 = Double.parseDouble("3.14"); // Convert string to Double
   ```

   5. **Using Class Methods**:

   ```java
   Integer num5 = Integer.valueOf("42");      // From string
   Long lng1 = Long.valueOf(42L);             // From long primitive
   ```

   Key points to remember:

   - `valueOf()` is preferred over constructors
   - Autoboxing provides the most concise syntax
   - Parsing methods are useful for converting strings
   - Each wrapper class has similar creation methods

6. **What are autoboxing and unboxing?**

   Autoboxing and unboxing are automatic conversions between primitive data types and their corresponding wrapper classes in Java:

   **Autoboxing**:

   - Automatic conversion of primitive types to their wrapper class objects
   - Example: `int` to `Integer`, `double` to `Double`
   - Happens when:
     - Assigning primitive to wrapper class variable
     - Passing primitive to method expecting wrapper
     - Adding primitive to collection

   **Unboxing**:

   - Automatic conversion of wrapper class objects to their primitive types
   - Example: `Integer` to `int`, `Double` to `double`
   - Happens when:
     - Assigning wrapper to primitive variable
     - Passing wrapper to method expecting primitive
     - Using wrapper in arithmetic operations

   Example demonstrating both:

   ```java
   // Autoboxing
   Integer num = 100;    // int -> Integer
   ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
   list.add(50);        // int -> Integer

   // Unboxing
   int value = num;     // Integer -> int
   int sum = num + 50;  // Integer -> int for calculation
   ```

   Benefits:

   - Simplifies code by eliminating explicit conversions
   - Enables primitives to work with collections
   - Makes code more readable and maintainable

7. **What are variable types?**

   | Variable Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Local Variables        | - Declared in methods, constructors, or blocks<br>- Created when the method, constructor or block is entered and destroyed once it exits<br>- No access modifiers can be used<br>- Visible only within the declared method, constructor, or block<br>- No default value, must be declared and initialized before use                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Instance Variables     | - Declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block<br>- Created when an object is created with the 'new' keyword and destroyed when the object is destroyed<br>- Can use access modifiers<br>- Visible for all methods, constructors and blocks in the class<br>- Have default values (0 for numbers, false for boolean, null for object references)<br>- Can be accessed directly by calling the variable name inside the class                                                                                           |
   | Class/Static Variables | - Declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or block<br>- Only one copy per class, regardless of how many objects are created<br>- Created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops<br>- Can be declared as public/private, final, and static<br>- Visible for all methods, constructors and blocks in the class<br>- Have default values (0 for numbers, false for boolean, null for object references)<br>- Can be accessed by calling with the class name: ClassName.VariableName |

8. **What is the difference between transient and volatile variable in Java?**

   | Feature | Transient                                                  | Volatile                                                   |
   | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Purpose | Controls object serialization                              | Ensures thread-safe access to variables                    |
   | Usage   | Marks fields that should not be serialized                 | Marks fields that may be modified by multiple threads      |
   | Scope   | Serialization process                                      | Multi-threaded environments                                |
   | Effect  | Field is skipped during serialization                      | Forces reads/writes directly to main memory                |
   | Default | null for objects, 0/false for primitives after deserialize | Retains actual value but ensures visibility across threads |

   Example of transient:

   ```java
   public class User implements Serializable {
       private String username;
       private transient String password; // won't be serialized
   }
   ```

   Example of volatile:

   ```java
   public class Counter {
       private volatile int count = 0; // ensures thread-safe access

       public void increment() {
           count++;
       }
   }
   ```

9. **What is Type Casting (Type Conversion)**

   Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another in Java. There are two types of type casting:

   1. Widening Casting (Implicit) - automatically converting a smaller type to a larger type size
      `byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double`

   - **Example**:

   ```java
   byte byteValue = 10;
   int intValue = byteValue; // Widening casting from byte to int
   ```

   1. Narrowing Casting (Explicit) - manually converting a larger type to a smaller size type
      `double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte`

   - **Example**:

   ```java
   double doubleValue = 9.78;
   int intValue = (int) doubleValue; // Narrowing casting from double to int
   ```

   Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type. Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value.

## Keywords & Language Features

1. **What is the difference between final, finally and finalize keywords in Java?**

   Here's a comparison of final, finally, and finalize keywords in Java:

   1. **final**:

      - Used to make variables, methods, or classes unchangeable/non-inheritable
      - Variables become constants
      - Methods cannot be overridden
      - Classes cannot be inherited

        ```java
        final class FinalExample {
            final int constant = 100;

            final void cannotOverride() {
                System.out.println("This method cannot be overridden");
            }
        }
        ```

   2. **finally**:

      - Used with try-catch blocks
      - Code in finally block always executes whether exception occurs or not
      - Used for cleanup operations like closing resources

        ```java
        try {
            // Some code that may throw exception
            FileReader file = new FileReader("file.txt");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exception
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            // Always executes
            System.out.println("Finally block executed");
            // Close resources here
        }
        ```

   3. **finalize**:

      - Method called by garbage collector before destroying object
      - Used to perform cleanup operations before object is garbage collected
      - Deprecated since Java 9

        ```java
        public class FinalizeExample {
            protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
                try {
                    // Cleanup operations
                    System.out.println("Finalize method called");
                } finally {
                    super.finalize();
                }
            }
        }
        ```

2. **What is the final and blank final variable?**

   1. **Final Variable**:

      - A variable declared with the `final` keyword
      - Value cannot be changed once assigned
      - Must be initialized when declared or in constructor
      - Acts as a constant in Java

      ```java
      final int MAX_VALUE = 100; // Initialized at declaration
      ```

   2. **Blank Final Variable**:

      - A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration
      - Must be initialized in all constructors
      - Provides flexibility to assign different values based on constructor
      - Can only be assigned once

      ```java
      public class Example {
          final int value; // Blank final variable

          public Example(int val) {
              value = val; // Initialized in constructor
          }
      }
      ```

3. **What is a compile time constant in Java?**

   A compile-time constant in Java is a variable that:

   - Is declared as `static final`
   - Is of primitive type or String
   - Is initialized with a constant expression at declaration
   - Value is known at compile time

   Example:

   ```java
   public class Constants {
       // Compile-time constants
       static final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
       static final String PREFIX = "user_";
       static final double PI = 3.14159;

       // Not compile-time constants
       static final int random = new Random().nextInt(); // Value not known at compile time
       static final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); // Not a primitive/String
   }
   ```

   Benefits:

   - Values are inlined by the compiler for better performance
   - No runtime overhead as values are resolved during compilation
   - Memory efficient as they are stored in the constant pool

4. **What is the significance of the this keyword in Java?**

   The `this` keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It has several important uses:

   1. **Distinguish Instance Variables from Parameters**:

      ```java
      public class Employee {
          private String name;
          public Employee(String name) {
              this.name = name; // 'this.name' refers to instance variable
          }
      }
      ```

   2. **Pass Current Object as Parameter**:

      ```java
      public class Chain {
          public Chain doSomething() {
              // some code
              return this; // returns current object for method chaining
          }
      }
      ```

   3. **Call Current Class Constructor**:

      ```java
      public class Person {
          public Person() {
              // default constructor
          }
          public Person(String name) {
              this(); // calls default constructor
              // additional initialization
          }
      }
      ```

   4. **Return Current Class Instance**:
      ```java
      public class Singleton {
          private static Singleton instance;
          public static Singleton getInstance() {
              if(instance == null) {
                  instance = new Singleton();
              }
              return instance;
          }
      }
      ```

5. **What is the super keyword in Java? When can you use the super keyword?**

   The `super` keyword in Java is a reference variable used to refer to the immediate parent class object. It allows you to access parent class members that are hidden or overridden by the child class.

   You can use the super keyword in the following ways:

   The `super` keyword in Java can be used in the following scenarios:

   1. **Call Parent Class Methods**:

      - When a method is overridden, use `super` to call the parent version
      - Example: `super.methodName()`

   2. **Access Parent Class Fields**:

      - Access fields from parent class that might be hidden by child class
      - Example: `super.fieldName`

   3. **Call Parent Class Constructor**:
      - Must be first statement in constructor
      - Example: `super()` or `super(parameters)`

   Example:

   ```java
   class Parent {
       String name = "Parent";
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Parent method");
       }
   }

   class Child extends Parent {
       String name = "Child";

       Child() {
           super(); // Call parent constructor
       }

       void display() {
           super.display(); // Call parent method
           System.out.println(super.name); // Access parent field
       }
   ```

6. **What are the differences between super and this keywords in Java?**

   | super keyword                                                           | this keyword                                                    |
   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Used to refer to the immediate parent class object                      | Used to refer to the current class object                       |
   | Used to access parent class members hidden by child class               | Used to access current class members                            |
   | Must be first statement in constructor when calling parent constructor  | Can be used anywhere within instance methods and constructors   |
   | Cannot be used in static context                                        | Cannot be used in static context                                |
   | Used with inheritance to differentiate between parent and child members | Used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters |
   | Example: `super.method()`, `super.variable`, `super()`                  | Example: `this.method()`, `this.variable`, `this()`             |

7. **Is it possible that the 'finally' block will not be executed? If yes then list the case.**

   Yes, there are a few cases where the finally block may not execute:

   1. If `System.exit()` is called within the try or catch block
   2. If the JVM crashes or is terminated abruptly
   3. If the thread executing the try-catch block is interrupted or killed
   4. If there is an infinite loop in the try or catch block
   5. If a fatal error occurs that causes the JVM to crash (e.g., OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError)

   Example with System.exit():

   ```java
   try {
       System.out.println("In try block");
       System.exit(0);  // Finally block won't execute
   } catch (Exception e) {
       System.out.println("In catch block");
   } finally {
       System.out.println("This won't be printed");
   }
   ```

8. **How many times is the finalize method called?**

   The finalize method is called only once for each object by the garbage collector before the object is garbage collected. However, there are important points to note:

   - There is no guarantee when or if finalize() will be called, as it depends on the garbage collector
   - An object can be resurrected during finalization, but finalize() won't be called again when that object becomes garbage again
   - Since Java 9, the finalize() method has been deprecated because it is inherently problematic and unpredictable
   - It's recommended to use try-with-resources or explicit cleanup methods instead of relying on finalize()

9. **Is it possible to use this keyword in Java to refer to the static members?**

   No, the `this` keyword cannot be used to refer to static members in Java. The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of a class, while static members belong to the class itself rather than any specific instance.

   To access static members, you should:

   - Use the class name: `ClassName.staticMember`
   - Or access directly within the same class: `staticMember`

   Example:

   ```java
   public class Example {
       private static int count = 0;
       private int instanceVar = 0;

       public void method() {
           this.instanceVar = 1;    // Valid - refers to instance variable
           this.count = 1;          // Invalid - cannot use this with static
           Example.count = 1;       // Valid - proper way to access static
           count = 1;               // Also valid when in same class
       }
   }
   ```

## Control Flow & Operators

1. **What are Operators? What are the types of Operators?**

   Java operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They allow us to execute various operations such as addition, subtraction, and comparisons. The different types of operators in Java are as follows:

   | Operator Type           | Description                                                                               |
   | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Arithmetic Operators    | Used for mathematical calculations (+, -, \*, /, %, ++, --).                              |
   | Relational Operators    | Used to compare two values (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ===, !==).                              |
   | Bitwise Operators       | Operate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations (&, \|, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>).             |
   | Logical Operators       | Used to combine multiple boolean expressions (&&, \|\| ,!).                               |
   | Assignment Operators    | Used to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=, &=, \|=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=). |
   | Miscellaneous Operators | Includes conditional (ternary) operator (`? :`), instanceof operator (`instanceof`).      |

2. **What is the difference between ++a and a++ increment operators?**

   The ++a (pre-increment) and a++ (post-increment) operators both increment a variable by 1, but they differ in when the increment occurs and what value is returned:

   **Pre-increment (++a)**:

   - Increments the value first, then returns the incremented value
   - The increment happens before the value is used in the expression

   **Post-increment (a++)**:

   - Returns the original value first, then increments
   - The increment happens after the value is used in the expression

   Example:

   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = ++a;  // a is incremented to 6, then b gets 6
   // Now a = 6, b = 6

   int x = 5;
   int y = x++;  // y gets 5, then x is incremented to 6
   // Now x = 6, y = 5
   ```

   This difference is particularly important in expressions and method calls where the returned value matters.

3. **What are loops? What are the types of loops?**

   Loops are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, depending on a specified condition. In Java, there are several types of loops that you can use to handle repetitive tasks:

   1. **while loop**: Repeats a statement or a group of statements while a given condition is true. The condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop body.

   2. **for loop**: Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It includes initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in a single line.

   3. **do...while loop**: Similar to the while loop, but it tests the condition at the end of the loop body, ensuring that the loop body is executed at least once.

   4. **Enhanced for loop (for-each loop)**: Introduced in Java 5, this loop is used to iterate over collections and arrays, simplifying the syntax for traversing elements.

4. **What are control statements in Java?**

   Control statements in Java are programming constructs that control the flow of program execution. They determine which parts of code are executed and in what order, based on certain conditions or requirements. The main types of control statements in Java are:

   1. **Selection/Conditional/Decision Making Statements**:

      - if statements
      - if-else statements
      - switch statements
      - nested if statements

   2. **Iterative/Loop Statements**:

      - for loops
      - while loops
      - do-while loops
      - enhanced for loops

   3. **Jump Statements**:
      - break statement
      - continue statement
      - return statement

   These statements allow programmers to create complex program logic and control program flow based on different conditions and requirements.

5. **What are Loop Control Statements? What are the types of Loop Control Statements?**

   Loop control statements are used to alter the flow of control in loops. They allow you to manage the execution of loop iterations based on certain conditions. The types of loop control statements in Java include:

   1. **break statement**: Exits the loop immediately, skipping any remaining iterations.
   2. **continue statement**: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
   3. **return statement**: Exits from the current method and returns control to the calling method, which can also affect loop execution if used within a loop.

6. **What is Decision Making? What are the types of Decision Making?**

   Decision making in programming refers to the process of making choices based on certain conditions. It allows the program to execute different paths of code based on the evaluation of these conditions. In Java, decision-making is primarily achieved through control statements.

   | Type of Decision Making | Description                                                                            |
   | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **if statement**        | Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.                             |
   | **if-else statement**   | Executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if it is false. |
   | **else if statement**   | Allows checking multiple conditions sequentially.                                      |
   | **switch statement**    | Selects one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable.           |

7. **What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?**

   | Aspect                 | while loop                                                             | do-while loop                                                |
   | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Condition Check**    | Checks condition before executing the loop body                        | Checks condition after executing the loop body               |
   | **Minimum Executions** | Zero or more times (may never execute if condition is initially false) | At least once (executes first, then checks condition)        |
   | **Syntax**             | `while(condition) { statements }`                                      | `do { statements } while(condition);`                        |
   | **Use Case**           | When you need to check a condition before executing any statements     | When you want to ensure the loop body executes at least once |
   | **Exit Control**       | Entry controlled loop - may exit before first execution                | Exit controlled loop - can only exit after first execution   |

8. **What is the difference between a for loop and an enhanced for loop?**

   | Aspect            | for loop                                                  | enhanced for loop/for-each loop                            |
   | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Syntax**        | `for(init; condition; increment) { statements }`          | `for(type element : array/collection) { statements }`      |
   | **Use Case**      | When you need control over loop iteration and index       | When you want to iterate through all elements sequentially |
   | **Index Access**  | Has direct access to loop counter/index                   | No direct access to index                                  |
   | **Flexibility**   | More flexible - can iterate in any order or skip elements | Less flexible - must iterate through all elements in order |
   | **Applicable On** | Arrays, collections, and general counting/iteration       | Only arrays and collections (Iterable objects)             |
   | **Modification**  | Can modify array/collection elements during iteration     | Modification during iteration not recommended              |

   Example of for loop:

   ```java
   for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
       System.out.println(array[i]);
   }
   ```

   Example of enhanced for loop:

   ```java
   for(int element : array) {
       System.out.println(element);
   }
   ```

## System & Runtime

1. **What is the purpose of the Runtime class and System class?**

   The Runtime class and System class serve different but important purposes in Java:

   **Runtime Class**:

   - Provides interface to interact with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
   - Only one instance per JVM (Singleton pattern)
   - Accessed using Runtime.getRuntime()
   - Used for:
     - Memory management (garbage collection e.g. totalMemory(), freeMemory(), gc())
     - Executing external processes (exec())
     - Getting system information
     - Shutdown hooks (addShutdownHook())
     - Shutting down JVM (exit())

   **System Class**:

   - Provides utility methods and standard I/O streams
   - All methods are static - no instantiation needed
   - Used for:
     - Standard input/output/error streams (System.in, System.out, System.err)
     - Environment variables and properties (getenv(), getProperty())
     - Array copying (arraycopy())
     - Current time in milliseconds (currentTimeMillis())
     - System garbage collection (gc())
     - System exit (exit())

   Key differences:

   - Runtime focuses on JRE interaction and process management
   - System provides utility methods for common system operations
   - Runtime uses singleton pattern, System has only static members
   - Runtime methods are instance methods, System methods are static

2. **What is the difference between System.out, System.err, and System.in?**

   In Java, System.out, System.err, and System.in are standard streams that serve different purposes:

   1. System.out:

      - This is the standard output stream
      - Used for normal program output
      - Typically prints to the console in black text
      - Common methods: println(), print(), printf()
      - Example: System.out.println("Hello World");

   2. System.err:

      - This is the standard error stream
      - Used for error messages and debugging information
      - Typically prints to the console in red text
      - Has the same methods as System.out
      - Example: System.err.println("Error occurred!");

   3. System.in:
      - This is the standard input stream
      - Used to read input from the keyboard/console
      - Returns data as bytes that need to be parsed
      - Often wrapped with Scanner or BufferedReader for easier use
      - Example: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

   Key differences:

   - Purpose: out for normal output, err for errors, in for input
   - Direction: out and err are output streams, in is an input stream
   - Visual: err typically shows in red, while out shows in black
   - Buffer: out is buffered, err is not (immediate output)

3. **What is a native method?**

   A native method is a method that is implemented in another programming language (typically C/C++) rather than in Java. Key points about native methods:

   - Declared with the `native` keyword in Java
   - Has no method body in Java code
   - Implementation is provided in platform-specific code
   - Used for:
     - Accessing system-specific functionality
     - Performance-critical code
     - Interfacing with legacy systems
     - Hardware interaction

   Example:

   ```java
   public class NativeExample {
       // Declares native method - no implementation in Java
       public native void performNativeOperation();

       static {
           // Loads the native library containing the implementation
           System.loadLibrary("nativeLib");
       }
   }
   ```

   Native methods require the Java Native Interface (JNI) to bridge between Java and native code. While powerful, they should be used sparingly as they:

   - Reduce platform independence
   - Can introduce security risks
   - Make debugging more difficult
   - Require additional build complexity

4. **What is the role and benefit of package in Java?**

   In Java, a package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. The primary role of packages is to group related classes together, which helps in avoiding name conflicts and controlling access.

   The benefits of using packages in Java include:

   1. **Namespace Management**: Packages help to avoid naming conflicts by grouping classes with similar functionality under a unique package name.

   2. **Access Protection**: Packages provide controlled access to classes and members. Classes within the same package can access each other's package-private and protected members, while classes in different packages cannot.

   3. **Code Organization**: Packages help in organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner, making it easier to locate and manage code.

   4. **Reusability**: By grouping related classes, packages promote code reusability, allowing developers to use existing classes in new applications without modification.

   5. **Modularity**: Packages encourage modular programming, where functionality is divided into separate, manageable components.

   Overall, packages play a crucial role in structuring Java applications, enhancing maintainability, and promoting best practices in software development.

## Advanced Features

1. **What are shallow copy and deep copy in Java?**

   In Java, object copying can be done in two ways: shallow copy and deep copy.

   **Shallow Copy:**

   - Creates a new object and copies all field values from the original object
   - For primitive fields, the actual values are copied
   - For reference fields, only the references are copied (both objects point to same memory location)
   - Faster and uses less memory
   - Changes to referenced objects in copy affect original

   Example of shallow copy:

   ```java
   class Person {
       String name;
       Address address; // Reference type

       public Person shallowCopy() {
           Person copy = new Person();
           copy.name = this.name;
           copy.address = this.address; // Only copies reference
           return copy;
       }
   }
   ```

   **Deep Copy:**

   - Creates a new object and recursively copies all fields
   - Creates new instances of all referenced objects
   - Both primitive and reference fields are fully copied
   - More expensive in terms of memory and processing
   - Changes to referenced objects in copy don't affect original

   Example of deep copy:

   ```java
   class Person {
       String name;
       Address address;

       public Person deepCopy() {
           Person copy = new Person();
           copy.name = this.name;
           copy.address = new Address(this.address); // Creates new Address object
           return copy;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Can you have virtual functions in Java?**

   In Java, all non-static methods are virtual by default. This means:

   - Methods can be overridden in subclasses without any special keyword
   - The actual method called is determined at runtime based on the object's type
   - This enables polymorphic behavior

   Example:

   ```java
   class Animal {
       public void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Some sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       @Override
       public void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Woof!");
       }
   }
   ```

   When calling the method:

   ```java
   Animal animal = new Dog();
   animal.makeSound(); // Prints "Woof!" - virtual method dispatch
   ```

   Only final, static, and private methods cannot be overridden, making them non-virtual.

3. **What are the observer and observable classes?**

   Observer and Observable are legacy classes from Java's built-in implementation of the Observer pattern:

   - Observable (now deprecated):

     - Base class for objects that want to notify observers
     - Maintains list of observers
     - Methods include addObserver(), deleteObserver(), notifyObservers()
     - Must call setChanged() before notification

   - Observer (now deprecated):
     - Interface implemented by objects that want to be notified
     - Has update() method called when Observable changes

   Example:

   ```java
   class NewsAgency extends Observable {
       private String news;

       public void setNews(String news) {
           this.news = news;
           setChanged();
           notifyObservers(news);
       }
   }

   class NewsChannel implements Observer {
       @Override
       public void update(Observable o, Object news) {
           System.out.println("Breaking News: " + news);
       }
   }
   ```

   Note: These classes are deprecated since Java 9. Modern alternatives include:

   - java.util.concurrent Flow API
   - Event listeners
   - PropertyChangeListener
   - Third-party reactive libraries (RxJava, Project Reactor)

4. **Why are generics used in Java Programming?**

   Generics enable type-safe programming by allowing you to write code that works with different types while providing compile-time type safety. Key benefits include:

   - Type safety: Catches type errors at compile-time rather than runtime
   - Elimination of type casting: No need for explicit casting when retrieving elements
   - Enable generic algorithms: Write code that works with different types

   Example:

   ```java
   // Without generics
   List list = new ArrayList();
   list.add("hello");
   String s = (String) list.get(0); // requires casting

   // With generics
   List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
   list.add("hello");
   String s = list.get(0); // no casting needed
   ```

   Common use cases:

   - Collection classes (List<T>, Map<K,V>)
   - Custom data structures
   - Methods that operate on different types
   - Type-safe APIs

5. **What are generics? How did you use them in your coding?**

   Generics in Java allow you to write classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different types while providing compile-time type safety. Here are some common examples:

   1. **Collections Framework**

      ```java
      List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
      Map<String, User> userMap = new HashMap<>();
      ```

   2. **Custom Generic Classes**

      ```java
      public class Result<T> {
          private T data;
          private String message;

          public T getData() { return data; }
          public void setData(T data) { this.data = data; }
      }
      ```

   3. **Generic Methods**

      ```java
      public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
          for(T element : array) {
              System.out.println(element);
          }
      }
      ```

   4. **Bounded Type Parameters**

      ```java
      public class NumberProcessor<T extends Number> {
          public double sum(List<T> numbers) {
              return numbers.stream()
                         .mapToDouble(Number::doubleValue)
                         .sum();
          }
      }
      ```

   5. **Wild Card Usage**
      ```java
      public void processElements(List<? extends Animal> animals) {
          for(Animal a : animals) {
              a.makeSound();
          }
      }
      ```

   Generics provide several benefits:

   - Type safety at compile-time
   - Elimination of type casting
   - Enable reusable code that works with different types
   - Support for generic algorithms and data structures

6. **Which of the below generates a compile-time error? State the reason.**

   ```java
   int[] n1 = new int[0];
   boolean[] n2 = new boolean[-200];
   double[] n3 = new double[2241423798];
   char[] ch = new char[20];
   ```

   - `n2` will generate a compile-time error because array sizes must be non-negative. The value -200 is negative.
   - `n3` will generate a compile-time error because the size exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647).
   - `n1` and `ch` are valid array declarations.

## Code Analysis & Debugging

1. **Is this program giving a compile-time error? If Yes then state the reason and number of errors it will give. If not then state the reason.**

   ```java
   abstract final class InterviewBit{
       public abstract void printMessage();
   }
   class ScalarAcademy extends InterviewBit{
       public void printMessage(){
           System.out.println("Welcome to Scalar Academy By InterviewBit");
       }
   }
   class ScalarTopics extends ScalarAcademy{
       public void printMessage(){
           System.out.println("Welcome to Scalar Topics By Scalar Academy");
       }
   }

   public class Main{
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           InterviewBit ib = new ScalarTopics();
           ib.printMessage();
       }
   }
   ```

   Yes, this program will give compile-time errors. There are 2 major issues:

   1. The `InterviewBit` class is declared as both `abstract` and `final`. This is illegal in Java because:

      - An abstract class is meant to be inherited from
      - A final class cannot be inherited from
        These modifiers contradict each other, causing a compile error.

   2. Since `InterviewBit` is declared as `final`, the class `ScalarAcademy` cannot extend it.
      This causes another compile error.

   Therefore, the program will generate 2 compile-time errors.

2. **Identify the output of the below java program and Justify your answer.**

   ```java
   class Main {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
       Scaler s = new Scaler(5);
       }
   }
   class InterviewBit{
       InterviewBit(){
           System.out.println(" Welcome to InterviewBit ");
       }
   }
   class Scaler extends InterviewBit{
       Scaler(){
           System.out.println(" Welcome to Scaler Academy ");
       }
       Scaler(int x){
           this();
           super();
           System.out.println(" Welcome to Scaler Academy 2");
       }
   }
   ```

   This program will result in a compile-time error. Here's why:

   1. When `new Scaler(5)` is called, it invokes the parameterized constructor `Scaler(int x)`
   2. Inside `Scaler(int x)`, `this()` is called first which invokes the default constructor `Scaler()`
   3. The default constructor `Scaler()` implicitly calls `super()` first to initialize the parent class
   4. After returning from `this()`, the constructor attempts to call `super()` explicitly
   5. This is illegal because:
      - Constructor calls to `this()` or `super()` must be the first statement in a constructor
      - A constructor cannot call both `this()` and `super()`

   Therefore, the code will not compile due to the invalid constructor chaining in `Scaler(int x)`.
