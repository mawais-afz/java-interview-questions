### Java Basics

1. **What is Java?**

   Java is a popular, versatile, and object-oriented programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability. It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. Java is used for developing a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise software.

2. **Why is Java Dynamic?**

   Java is considered dynamic due to several key features:

   - **Dynamic Class Loading**: Java can load classes at runtime as needed, rather than loading all classes at startup
   - **Reflection**: Allows programs to examine and modify their structure and behavior at runtime
   - **Late Binding**: Method calls are resolved at runtime rather than compile time
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Objects are allocated memory dynamically at runtime
   - **Runtime Polymorphism**: The specific method implementation to be executed is determined at runtime
   - **Dynamic Array Bounds**: Array bounds are checked dynamically at runtime
   - **Dynamic Security**: Security policies can be configured and enforced at runtime

3. **Explain the main idea behind Java and the concept of Write Once, Run Anywhere**

   The main idea behind Java is to create a language that is simple, secure, and platform-independent. The concept of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) is one of Java's core principles, which means:

   - Java code is first compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode
   - This bytecode can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed
   - The JVM acts as an interpreter between the bytecode and the underlying operating system
   - Developers don't need to rewrite or recompile code for different platforms
   - The same Java application can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, or any other platform with a JVM
   - This platform independence significantly reduces development and maintenance costs

   This approach differs from traditional languages like C/C++, which require platform-specific compilation and often need code modifications to work on different operating systems.

4. **List some important features of Java.**

   - **Platform Independence**: Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, making them highly portable.
   - **Object-Oriented**: Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, which helps in organizing complex programs into simpler, reusable pieces.
   - **Robust and Secure**: Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and security features that make it a reliable and secure language.
   - **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization of CPU.
   - **Automatic Memory Management**: Java uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks and other related issues.
   - **Rich Standard Library**: Java comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides many useful utilities and frameworks for various tasks.
   - **High Performance**: Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler and efficient runtime environment contribute to its high performance.
   - **Distributed Computing**: Java supports distributed computing through its networking capabilities, making it suitable for developing large-scale distributed applications.
   - **Dynamic and Extensible**: Java is designed to adapt to evolving environments, with features like dynamic class loading and reflection.
   - **Community Support**: Java has a large and active community, providing extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks to support development.

5. **Can you list some non-object oriented features of Java?**

   - **Primitive Data Types**: Java supports eight primitive data types (byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char) that are not objects.
   - **Static Members**: Static methods and variables belong to the class rather than instances, resembling procedural programming.
   - **Arrays**: While arrays are objects in Java, they provide low-level, fixed-size data storage similar to procedural languages.
   - **Operator Overloading**: Java deliberately excludes operator overloading to maintain simplicity, unlike some OOP languages.
   - **Multiple Inheritance**: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes (though it allows multiple interface implementation).
   - **Procedural Programming**: Java allows writing procedural code within methods, without necessarily using objects.
   - **Pass-by-Value**: Java strictly uses pass-by-value semantics, even for object references.
   - **Global Variables**: Through static fields, Java provides a way to create globally accessible variables.
   - **Command-Line Programming**: Java supports console-based, procedural programming through the main method.

6. **What is JVM and is it platform independent?**

   The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial component of the Java runtime environment that provides a platform-independent execution environment for Java applications.

   **Key Characteristics of JVM**:

   - **Platform Independence**: While the JVM itself is NOT platform-independent, it enables platform independence for Java applications
   - Acts as an abstraction layer between Java bytecode and the underlying hardware/operating system
   - Different JVM implementations exist for different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)
   - Translates Java bytecode into machine-specific instructions at runtime

   **Platform Independence Mechanism**:

   - Java source code is compiled into platform-independent bytecode
   - Each operating system has its own JVM implementation
   - The same Java bytecode can run on any platform with a compatible JVM
   - This approach allows "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) functionality

   **JVM Responsibilities**:

   - Code verification and security
   - Memory management
   - Garbage collection
   - Converting bytecode to machine-specific instructions
   - Providing runtime environment for Java applications

7. **What is the difference between JavaEE and JavaSE?**

   JavaSE (Java Standard Edition) and JavaEE (Java Enterprise Edition) are different platforms within the Java ecosystem:

   **Java SE (Standard Edition)**:

   - The core Java platform, providing fundamental Java programming features
   - Contains core libraries and APIs for general-purpose programming
   - Includes basic functionality like collections, I/O, networking, GUI development
   - Used for developing desktop and simple server applications
   - Foundation for other Java editions

   **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**:

   - Built on top of JavaSE, adding enterprise features
   - Designed for developing large-scale, distributed, multi-tiered enterprise applications
   - Provides additional APIs and services for:
     - Web Applications (Servlets, JSP)
     - Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
     - Java Persistence API (JPA)
     - Java Message Service (JMS)
     - Java Transaction API (JTA)
     - Web Services
   - Includes specifications for security, scalability, and reliability
   - Requires an application server (like WildFly, WebSphere, or GlassFish)

   Note: JavaEE has been renamed to Jakarta EE after Oracle transferred it to the Eclipse Foundation.

8. **Explain JDK, JRE, and JVM**

   | Component | Full Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | JDK       | Java Development Kit     | A software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development. |
   | JRE       | Java Runtime Environment | Provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files.                                                                                               |
   | JVM       | Java Virtual Machine     | An abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed, ensuring platform independence.                                                               |

9. **What is a ClassLoader? And its role in Java?**

   A ClassLoader in Java is a fundamental component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) responsible for loading Java classes and interfaces into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) during runtime. Its primary role is to convert Java bytecode (.class files) into Class objects that can be used by the JVM.

   Key responsibilities of a ClassLoader include:

   - **Loading Classes**: Reads the bytecode from .class files and creates Class objects
   - **Security**: Ensures classes are loaded from trusted sources and meet Java specifications
   - **Namespace Management**: Maintains separate namespaces for different types of classes
   - **Dynamic Loading**: Loads classes on-demand when they are first referenced

   Java provides three built-in ClassLoaders, each with specific responsibilities:

   - **Bootstrap ClassLoader**:

     - Written in native code (not Java)
     - Loads core Java API classes from rt.jar
     - Parent of all other ClassLoaders

   - **Extension ClassLoader**:

     - Loads classes from extension directories (JAVA_HOME/lib/ext)
     - Child of Bootstrap ClassLoader

   - **System/Application ClassLoader**:
     - Loads application classes from classpath
     - Child of Extension ClassLoader
     - Used to load application-specific classes

   ClassLoaders follow important principles:

   1. **Delegation Hierarchy**: Before loading a class, a ClassLoader asks its parent first
   2. **Visibility**: Child ClassLoaders can see classes loaded by parents, but not vice versa
   3. **Uniqueness**: Same class loaded by different ClassLoaders are treated as different types
   4. **Non-delegation**: Each ClassLoader should load a class only once

10. **What is the difference between path and classpath?**

    | Aspect  | PATH                                                   | CLASSPATH                                           |
    | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
    | Purpose | System environment variable to locate executables      | Java-specific variable to locate class files        |
    | Usage   | Finds OS commands and programs (e.g., java, javac)     | Helps JVM find and load Java classes during runtime |
    | Content | Directory paths containing executable files            | Paths to .class files, JAR files, and packages      |
    | Scope   | Operating system level                                 | Java application level                              |
    | Format  | OS-specific path separator (: for Unix, ; for Windows) | Similar path separator but for Java class locations |
    | Default | Usually pre-configured by OS installation              | Current directory (.) if not explicitly set         |

    Example PATH:

    ```
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
    ```

    Example CLASSPATH:

    ```
    .:/home/user/classes:/home/user/lib/example.jar
    ```

11. **What is JIT compiler in Java?**

    - **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler** is a crucial component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    - Converts Java bytecode to native machine code at runtime
    - Improves performance by compiling frequently executed code paths (hot spots)

    Key characteristics:

    - Part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
    - Dynamically compiles bytecode to native machine instructions
    - Optimizes code execution in real-time
    - Reduces interpretation overhead
    - Provides adaptive optimization based on runtime behavior

    How JIT Compiler Works:

    1. Initially, Java bytecode is interpreted by the JVM
    2. Identifies frequently executed code segments
    3. Compiles these segments to native machine code
    4. Caches and reuses the compiled native code
    5. Continuously monitors and re-optimizes code performance

    Benefits:

    - Faster execution compared to pure interpretation
    - Platform-independent performance optimization
    - Reduces memory footprint
    - Enables runtime-specific code optimizations

12. **Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?**

    - The Java Compiler (javac) is stored in the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
    - JDK is the complete software development kit for Java
    - Contains tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications

    Key points:

    - JRE (Java Runtime Environment) only contains the runtime environment
    - JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is responsible for executing bytecode
    - JDK includes:
      - Java Compiler (javac)
      - Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
      - Development Tools
      - Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

    Comparison:

    - JDK: Includes compiler, used by developers
    - JRE: Runs Java applications, does not include compiler
    - JVM: Executes Java bytecode, part of both JDK and JRE

### Memory Management

1. **What are the Memory Allocations available in Java**

   Java's memory structure consists of several key areas:

   1. **Stack Memory**:

      - Used for storing method frames and local variables
      - Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order
      - Automatically allocated and deallocated
      - Thread-specific - each thread has its own stack
      - Stores primitive values and object references

   2. **Heap Memory**:

      - Shared runtime memory area
      - Stores all objects and arrays
      - Managed by Garbage Collector
      - Divided into:
        - Young Generation (Eden Space, Survivor Spaces)
        - Old Generation
        - Permanent Generation (Removed in Java 8+)

   3. **Class(Method) Area (Metaspace)**:

      - Stores class metadata, methods, and static variables
      - Shared across all threads
      - Part of native memory (not heap) since Java 8

   4. **Program Counter (PC) Register**:

      - Per-thread register
      - Holds address of current executing instruction
      - Helps with thread execution management

   5. **Native Method Stack**:
      - Supports native method execution
      - Used for C/C++ calls from Java
      - One per thread

   Each memory area serves a specific purpose in Java's memory management system, contributing to the language's efficiency and reliability.

2. **What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?**

   | Aspect            | Stack Memory                                                 | Heap Memory                                     |
   | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
   | Memory Type       | Static memory allocation                                     | Dynamic memory allocation                       |
   | Access Speed      | Faster access                                                | Relatively slower access                        |
   | Memory Management | Automatic (LIFO order)                                       | Manual allocation, automatic deallocation by GC |
   | Size              | Smaller, fixed size                                          | Larger, flexible size                           |
   | Thread Safety     | Each thread has own stack                                    | Shared across all threads                       |
   | Storage           | Primitive values, method frames, local variables, references | Objects, arrays, class instances                |
   | Lifetime          | Short-lived - exists for method duration                     | Objects persist until no references remain      |
   | Memory Order      | Contiguous memory blocks                                     | No specific memory order                        |
   | Memory Control    | Size controlled by JVM (-Xss)                                | Initial/Max size controlled by JVM (-Xms/-Xmx)  |
   | Memory Errors     | StackOverflowError                                           | OutOfMemoryError                                |

3. **How does garbage collection work in Java?**

   Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is an automatic memory management process that identifies and removes unused objects from heap memory. Here's how it works:

   1. **Mark Phase**:

      - GC identifies all objects that are still in use (reachable)
      - Starting from "root" references (stack, static variables, etc.)
      - Traverses object graph to mark live objects

   2. **Sweep Phase**:
      - Removes unmarked objects (garbage)
      - Compacts remaining space (in some GC algorithms)
      - Frees memory for future allocations

   Key aspects of Java's Garbage Collection:

   - **Generational Collection**:
     - Young Generation (for new objects)
       - Eden Space (initial allocation)
       - Survivor Spaces (for objects surviving collection)
     - Old Generation (for long-lived objects)
   - **Collection Types**:

     - Minor GC: Collects Young Generation
     - Major GC: Collects Old Generation
     - Full GC: Collects entire heap

   - **GC Algorithms**:
     - Serial GC: Single-threaded, simple
     - Parallel GC: Multi-threaded collection
     - CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep): Minimizes pauses
     - G1 (Garbage First): Region-based collection
     - ZGC: Low-latency collector (Java 11+)

   Note: While automatic, GC can impact application performance during collection cycles.

4. **What are the possible ways of making object eligible for garbage collection (GC) in Java?**

   An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when it is no longer reachable. Here are the main ways to make an object eligible for GC:

   1. **Nullifying References**:

      - Set object references to null
      - Example: `Student student = new Student(); student = null;`

   2. **Reassigning References**:

      - Point reference variable to another object
      - Original object becomes unreachable
      - Example: `student = new Student();` // old object eligible for GC

   3. **Object goes out of Scope**:

      - Local objects become eligible when method ends
      - Example:
        ```java
        void method() {
            Student student = new Student(); // eligible after method ends
        }
        ```

   4. **Island of Isolation**:

      - Objects only reference each other but no external references
      - Example:
        ```java
        class Node {
            Node next;
            // Circular reference but no external reference
            Node a = new Node();
            Node b = new Node();
            a.next = b;
            b.next = a;
            a = b = null; // Island now eligible for GC
        }
        ```

   5. **Removing References from Collections**:
      - Clear collections or remove objects from them
      - Example: `list.clear();` or `map.remove(key);`

### Variables and Data Types

1. **What is a Java Variable?**

   A Java variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value of a specific data type. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program.

   | Aspect            | Description                                                                                                        |
   | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Definition        | A named container for storing data values                                                                          |
   | Declaration       | Specifies the variable's name and data type                                                                        |
   | Initialization    | Assigns an initial value to the variable                                                                           |
   | Scope             | Determines where the variable can be accessed within the code                                                      |
   | Data Types        | Can be primitive (byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char) or reference (objects, arrays, interfaces) |
   | Naming Convention | Follows camelCase, starts with a letter, $, or \_                                                                  |
   | Example           | `int age = 25;` or `String name = "John";`                                                                         |

2. **What is the difference between final, finally and finalize keywords in Java?**

   Here's a comparison of final, finally, and finalize keywords in Java:

   1. **final**:

      - Used to make variables, methods, or classes unchangeable/non-inheritable
      - Variables become constants
      - Methods cannot be overridden
      - Classes cannot be inherited

        ```java
        final class FinalExample {
            final int constant = 100;

            final void cannotOverride() {
                System.out.println("This method cannot be overridden");
            }
        }
        ```

   2. **finally**:

      - Used with try-catch blocks
      - Code in finally block always executes whether exception occurs or not
      - Used for cleanup operations like closing resources

        ```java
        try {
            // Some code that may throw exception
            FileReader file = new FileReader("file.txt");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exception
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            // Always executes
            System.out.println("Finally block executed");
            // Close resources here
        }
        ```

   3. **finalize**:

      - Method called by garbage collector before destroying object
      - Used to perform cleanup operations before object is garbage collected
      - Deprecated since Java 9

        ```java
        public class FinalizeExample {
            protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
                try {
                    // Cleanup operations
                    System.out.println("Finalize method called");
                } finally {
                    super.finalize();
                }
            }
        }
        ```

3. **What is the final blank variable?**

   A final blank variable (or blank final variable) is a final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration. Key points about blank final variables:

   - Must be initialized exactly once, either in instance initializer block or constructor
   - Can be initialized based on some logic/computation
   - Once initialized, cannot be changed
   - Useful when the final value depends on some constructor parameters

   Example:

   ```java
   public class Example {
       final int blankFinal; // blank final variable

       public Example(int value) {
           this.blankFinal = value; // initialized in constructor
       }
   }
   ```

4. **What is the difference between final and blank final variable?**

   | Final Variable                                     | Blank Final Variable                                                                  |
   | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Must be initialized at the time of declaration     | Must be initialized exactly once, either in constructor or instance initializer block |
   | Cannot be changed after initialization             | Cannot be changed after initialization                                                |
   | Example: `final int MAX_VALUE = 100;`              | Example: `final int blankFinal; // initialized in constructor`                        |
   | Initialized immediately and directly               | Can be initialized based on some logic or constructor parameters                      |
   | Applicable to both static and non-static variables | Typically used with instance variables                                                |

   Code Example:

   ```java
   public class FinalVsBlankFinalExample {
       final int directFinal = 10;        // Final variable
       final int blankFinal;               // Blank final variable

       public FinalVsBlankFinalExample(int value) {
           this.blankFinal = value;        // Initialized in constructor
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Is it possible that the 'finally' block will not be executed? If yes then list the case.**

   Yes, there are a few cases where the finally block may not execute:

   1. If `System.exit()` is called within the try or catch block
   2. If the JVM crashes or is terminated abruptly
   3. If the thread executing the try-catch block is interrupted or killed
   4. If there is an infinite loop in the try or catch block
   5. If a fatal error occurs that causes the JVM to crash (e.g., OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError)

   Example with System.exit():

   ```java
   try {
       System.out.println("In try block");
       System.exit(0);  // Finally block won't execute
   } catch (Exception e) {
       System.out.println("In catch block");
   } finally {
       System.out.println("This won't be printed");
   }
   ```

6. **How many times is the finalize method called?**

   The finalize method is called only once for each object by the garbage collector before the object is garbage collected. However, there are important points to note:

   - There is no guarantee when or if finalize() will be called, as it depends on the garbage collector
   - An object can be resurrected during finalization, but finalize() won't be called again when that object becomes garbage again
   - Since Java 9, the finalize() method has been deprecated because it is inherently problematic and unpredictable
   - It's recommended to use try-with-resources or explicit cleanup methods instead of relying on finalize()

7. **What is a compile time constant in Java?**

A compile-time constant in Java is a constant variable that is:
- Declared with the `static` and `final` keywords
- Initialized with a constant expression at the time of declaration
- Evaluated by the compiler at compile-time
- Directly substituted into the code where it is used (inlined)

Characteristics:
- Must be a primitive type or a String
- Value must be known at compile-time
- Cannot be changed after initialization
- Typically used for mathematical constants, configuration values, or magic numbers

Example:

7. **What is the significance of the `this` keyword in Java?**

   The `this` keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It has several important uses:

   1. **Distinguish Instance Variables from Parameters**:

      ```java
      public class Employee {
          private String name;
          public Employee(String name) {
              this.name = name; // 'this.name' refers to instance variable
          }
      }
      ```

   2. **Pass Current Object as Parameter**:

      ```java
      public class Chain {
          public Chain doSomething() {
              // some code
              return this; // returns current object for method chaining
          }
      }
      ```

   3. **Call Current Class Constructor**:

      ```java
      public class Person {
          public Person() {
              // default constructor
          }
          public Person(String name) {
              this(); // calls default constructor
              // additional initialization
          }
      }
      ```

   4. **Return Current Class Instance**:
      ```java
      public class Singleton {
          private static Singleton instance;
          public static Singleton getInstance() {
              if(instance == null) {
                  instance = new Singleton();
              }
              return instance;
          }
      }
      ```

8. **Is it possible to use this keyword in Java to refer to the static members?**

   No, the `this` keyword cannot be used to refer to static members in Java. The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of a class, while static members belong to the class itself rather than any specific instance.

   To access static members, you should:

   - Use the class name: `ClassName.staticMember`
   - Or access directly within the same class: `staticMember`

   Example:

   ```java
   public class Example {
       private static int count = 0;
       private int instanceVar = 0;

       public void method() {
           this.instanceVar = 1;    // Valid - refers to instance variable
           this.count = 1;          // Invalid - cannot use this with static
           Example.count = 1;       // Valid - proper way to access static
           count = 1;               // Also valid when in same class
       }
   }
   ```

9. **What are variable types?**

   | Variable Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Local Variables        | - Declared in methods, constructors, or blocks<br>- Created when the method, constructor or block is entered and destroyed once it exits<br>- No access modifiers can be used<br>- Visible only within the declared method, constructor, or block<br>- No default value, must be declared and initialized before use                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Instance Variables     | - Declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block<br>- Created when an object is created with the 'new' keyword and destroyed when the object is destroyed<br>- Can use access modifiers<br>- Visible for all methods, constructors and blocks in the class<br>- Have default values (0 for numbers, false for boolean, null for object references)<br>- Can be accessed directly by calling the variable name inside the class                                                                                           |
   | Class/Static Variables | - Declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or block<br>- Only one copy per class, regardless of how many objects are created<br>- Created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops<br>- Can be declared as public/private, final, and static<br>- Visible for all methods, constructors and blocks in the class<br>- Have default values (0 for numbers, false for boolean, null for object references)<br>- Can be accessed by calling with the class name: ClassName.VariableName |

10. **What is the difference between transient and volatile variable in Java?**

    | Feature | Transient                                                  | Volatile                                                   |
    | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Purpose | Controls object serialization                              | Ensures thread-safe access to variables                    |
    | Usage   | Marks fields that should not be serialized                 | Marks fields that may be modified by multiple threads      |
    | Scope   | Serialization process                                      | Multi-threaded environments                                |
    | Effect  | Field is skipped during serialization                      | Forces reads/writes directly to main memory                |
    | Default | null for objects, 0/false for primitives after deserialize | Retains actual value but ensures visibility across threads |

    Example of transient:

    ```java
    public class User implements Serializable {
        private String username;
        private transient String password; // won't be serialized
    }
    ```

    Example of volatile:

    ```java
    public class Counter {
        private volatile int count = 0; // ensures thread-safe access

        public void increment() {
            count++;
        }
    }
    ```

11. **What are data types?**

    Data types in Java specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Java has two categories of data types:

    | Category             | Data Types    | Description                                                                                                                                                | Size    |
    | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
    | Primitive Data Types | byte          | - 8-bit signed two's complement integer<br>- Minimum value is -128 (-2^7)<br>- Maximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)<br>- Default value is 0<br>        | 1 byte  |
    |                      | short         | - 16-bit signed two's complement integer<br>- Minimum value is -32,768 (-2^15)<br>- Maximum value is 32,767 (inclusive) (2^15 -1)<br>- Default value is 0. | 2 bytes |
    |                      | int           | 32-bit signed two's complement integer                                                                                                                     | 4 bytes |
    |                      | long          | 64-bit signed two's complement integer                                                                                                                     | 8 bytes |
    |                      | float         | Single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point                                                                                                            | 4 bytes |
    |                      | double        | Double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point                                                                                                            | 8 bytes |
    |                      | boolean       | true or false                                                                                                                                              | 1 bit   |
    |                      | char          | 16-bit Unicode character                                                                                                                                   | 2 bytes |
    | Reference Data Types | Class objects | User-defined types                                                                                                                                         | Varies  |
    |                      | Array         | Collection of similar data types                                                                                                                           | Varies  |
    |                      | Interface     | Abstract type                                                                                                                                              | N/A     |

    Primitive types are predefined by the language and named by a keyword. Reference data types are created by the programmer and are not defined by the language (except for String).

12. **What is Type Casting (Type Conversion)**

    Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another in Java. There are two types of type casting:

    1. Widening Casting (Implicit) - automatically converting a smaller type to a larger type size
       `byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double`

    - **Example**:

    ```java
    byte byteValue = 10;
    int intValue = byteValue; // Widening casting from byte to int
    ```

    1. Narrowing Casting (Explicit) - manually converting a larger type to a smaller size type
       `double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte`

    - **Example**:

    ```java
    double doubleValue = 9.78;
    int intValue = (int) doubleValue; // Narrowing casting from double to int
    ```

    Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type. Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value.

13. **What are autoboxing and unboxing?**

    Autoboxing and unboxing are automatic conversions between primitive data types and their corresponding wrapper classes in Java:

    **Autoboxing**:

    - Automatic conversion of primitive types to their wrapper class objects
    - Example: `int` to `Integer`, `double` to `Double`
    - Happens when:
      - Assigning primitive to wrapper class variable
      - Passing primitive to method expecting wrapper
      - Adding primitive to collection

    **Unboxing**:

    - Automatic conversion of wrapper class objects to their primitive types
    - Example: `Integer` to `int`, `Double` to `double`
    - Happens when:
      - Assigning wrapper to primitive variable
      - Passing wrapper to method expecting primitive
      - Using wrapper in arithmetic operations

    Example demonstrating both:

    ```java
    // Autoboxing
    Integer num = 100;    // int -> Integer
    ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    list.add(50);        // int -> Integer

    // Unboxing
    int value = num;     // Integer -> int
    int sum = num + 50;  // Integer -> int for calculation
    ```

    Benefits:

    - Simplifies code by eliminating explicit conversions
    - Enables primitives to work with collections
    - Makes code more readable and maintainable

14. **What are Operators? What are the types of Operators?**

    Java operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They allow us to execute various operations such as addition, subtraction, and comparisons. The different types of operators in Java are as follows:

    | Operator Type           | Description                                                                               |
    | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Arithmetic Operators    | Used for mathematical calculations (+, -, \*, /, %, ++, --).                              |
    | Relational Operators    | Used to compare two values (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ===, !==).                              |
    | Bitwise Operators       | Operate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations (&, \|, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>).             |
    | Logical Operators       | Used to combine multiple boolean expressions (&&, \|\| ,!).                               |
    | Assignment Operators    | Used to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=, &=, \|=, ^=, <<=, >>=, >>>=). |
    | Miscellaneous Operators | Includes conditional (ternary) operator (`? :`), instanceof operator (`instanceof`).      |

15. **What is the difference between ++a and a++ increment operators?**

    The ++a (pre-increment) and a++ (post-increment) operators both increment a variable by 1, but they differ in when the increment occurs and what value is returned:

    **Pre-increment (++a)**:

    - Increments the value first, then returns the incremented value
    - The increment happens before the value is used in the expression

    **Post-increment (a++)**:

    - Returns the original value first, then increments
    - The increment happens after the value is used in the expression

    Example:

    ```java
    int a = 5;
    int b = ++a;  // a is incremented to 6, then b gets 6
    // Now a = 6, b = 6

    int x = 5;
    int y = x++;  // y gets 5, then x is incremented to 6
    // Now x = 6, y = 5
    ```

    This difference is particularly important in expressions and method calls where the returned value matters.
