# Java 8 & and Newer Features

1. **What is parallel processing in Java 8?**

   - Parallel processing in Java 8 refers to the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging multi-core processors to improve performance and efficiency.
   - Java 8 introduced the `ForkJoinPool` framework and the `Stream` API, which allow developers to easily perform parallel operations on collections.
   - By using the `parallelStream()` method, developers can process data in parallel, enabling better resource utilization and faster execution times for large datasets.
   - Example:
     ```java
     List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");
     names.parallelStream()
          .forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
     ```
   - This approach can significantly reduce the time taken for operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing when working with large collections.
   - However, it is important to consider thread safety and the overhead of managing multiple threads when using parallel processing.
