# Testing in Java

1. **What is JUnit?**
   JUnit is a popular open-source unit testing framework for Java programming. It allows developers to write and run repeatable tests to ensure the correctness of their code. Key features include:
   - Provides annotations like @Test to mark test methods
   - Offers a wide range of assertion methods to validate expected outcomes
   - Supports test fixtures, parameterized tests, and test suites
   - Integrates seamlessly with build tools like Maven and IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ
   - Helps in test-driven development (TDD) by making it easy to write and run automated tests

2. **What are Assertions in Java?**
   Assertions are a debugging aid in Java that allow developers to test assumptions about the state of a program during development. Key points include:
   - Introduced in Java 1.4 as a language feature
   - Used to verify internal program logic and catch logical errors early
   - Enabled using the `assert` keyword
   - Can be used to check preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
   - Typically disabled in production code for performance reasons
   - Syntax: `assert condition;` or `assert condition : "error message";`
   - When an assertion fails, it throws an `AssertionError`
   - Useful for catching programming errors during testing and development
   - Can be selectively enabled or disabled using the `-ea` or `-da` JVM flags
