1. **What is a design pattern?**

   A design pattern is a well-proven solution for solving specific problems/tasks in software development. Design patterns are reusable solutions that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide a template for solving issues that can be used in many different situations.

   Key points about design patterns:

   - They are reusable across different problems and projects
   - They provide solutions that help to make code more flexible, reusable and maintainable
   - They provide a template for solving problems that can be used in many different situations
   - They are language-neutral and can be applied to any object-oriented programming language
   - They help to create a shared vocabulary for communicating solutions between developers

2. **What are the different categories of Java Design patterns?**

   Java Design Patterns are mainly divided into three categories:

   1. **Creational Design Patterns**

      - These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms
      - They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented
      - Examples: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype

   2. **Structural Design Patterns**

      - These patterns deal with object composition and relationships between objects
      - They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change
      - Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy

   3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**
      - These patterns deal with communication between objects
      - They characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time
      - Examples: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor
